# Accident-Detection-and-Smart-Alerting-System
This is a project using Node-MCU microcontroller that controls various sensors.
Accelerometer is used to detect the changes in directions of vehicle in X Y Z axes and if it exceeds a certain threshold an alert will be generated.
Alongwith alert (beep) we have developed an application using MIT app inventor that tracks the loaction of the vehicle and sends the notification of location through coordinates to the concerned authorities.
